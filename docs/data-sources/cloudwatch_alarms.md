# test_cloudwatch_alarms

Use this data source to get information about CloudWatch alarms. This data source calls the AWS CloudWatch DescribeAlarms API to retrieve alarm information based on specified criteria.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic usage - get all metric alarms
data "test_cloudwatch_alarms" "basic" {
  alarm_type = "MetricAlarm"
}

# Filter by alarm name prefix
data "test_cloudwatch_alarms" "alarm_name_prefix" {
  alarm_name_prefix = "test-"
}

# Get specific alarms by name
data "test_cloudwatch_alarms" "alarm_names" {
  alarm_names = ["test-alarm-1", "test-alarm-2"]
}

# Filter by state value
data "test_cloudwatch_alarms" "state_value" {
  state_value = "INSUFFICIENT_DATA"
}

# Get composite alarms
data "test_cloudwatch_alarms" "composite" {
  alarm_type = "CompositeAlarm"
}

# Include Auto Scaling alarms (default behavior is to ignore them)
data "test_cloudwatch_alarms" "include_autoscaling" {
  ignore_autoscaling_alarms = false
}

# Combined filters
data "test_cloudwatch_alarms" "combined" {
  alarm_type = "MetricAlarm"
  alarm_name_prefix = "prod-"
  state_value = "ALARM"
  ignore_autoscaling_alarms = true
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `alarm_name_prefix` (String) The prefix of the alarm name to filter by.

- `alarm_type` (String) The type of alarm to retrieve. Valid values are 'MetricAlarm' and 'CompositeAlarm'. Defaults to 'MetricAlarm'.
- `ignore_autoscaling_alarms` (Boolean) If true, filters out alarms whose names start with 'TargetTracking-'. These are typically Auto Scaling target tracking alarms. Defaults to true.
- `state_value` (String) The state value to filter by. Valid values are 'OK', 'ALARM', and 'INSUFFICIENT_DATA'.

### Read-Only

- `alarms` (Block List) List of CloudWatch alarms matching the criteria. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--alarms))
- `id` (String) The ID of the data source.

- `metric_name` (String) The name of the metric associated with the alarm.
- `namespace` (String) The namespace of the metric associated with the alarm.
- `ok_actions` (List of String) The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions to an OK state.

# test_ssm_activations

The `test_ssm_activations` data source retrieves information about multiple SSM activations using filters and pagination. This data source calls the AWS SSM DescribeActivations API to retrieve activation details including IAM role, registration limits, expiration date, and other metadata.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get all non-expired activations
data "test_ssm_activations" "non_expired" {
  expired = false
}

# Get all expired activations
data "test_ssm_activations" "expired" {
  expired = true
}

# Get activations by specific IDs
data "test_ssm_activations" "by_ids" {
  filter {
    name = "activation-ids"
    values = ["07dea21a-e2af-4915-a029-b1706045595a"]
  }
}

# Get activations by IAM role
data "test_ssm_activations" "by_role" {
  filter {
    name = "iam-role"
    values = ["hybrid-activation"]
  }
}

# Combine filters (cumulative)
data "test_ssm_activations" "combined" {
  expired = true
  filter {
    name = "activation-ids"
    values = ["07dea21a-e2af-4915-a029-b1706045595a"]
  }
  filter {
    name = "iam-role"
    values = ["hybrid-activation"]
  }
}

output "activation_details" {
  value = data.test_ssm_activations.combined.activations
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `expired` (Boolean) Filter activations by expiration status. If not specified, returns both expired and non-expired activations.
- `filter` (Block List) Filter activations by specific criteria. Multiple filters are cumulative (AND operation). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))

### Read-Only

- `activations` (Attributes List) List of SSM activations matching the specified filters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--activations))
- `id` (String) The ID of the data source (always 'ssm_activations').

<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the filter. Valid values are: 'activation-ids', 'iam-role', 'default-instance-name'.
- `values` (List of String) The values for the filter.


<a id="nestedatt--activations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `activations`

Read-Only:

- `activation_id` (String) The ID of the SSM activation.
- `created_date` (String) The date and time when the activation was created.
- `expiration_date` (String) The date and time when the activation expires.
- `expired` (Boolean) Whether the activation has expired.
- `iam_role` (String) The IAM role associated with the activation.
- `registration_limit` (Number) The maximum number of managed instances that can be registered with this activation.
- `registrations_count` (Number) The number of managed instances currently registered with this activation.
